Description
===========

This are little interpreter in brainfuck. It is my favourite "hello world"
program when discovering a new programming language.

These programs are real (yet simple) virtual machine. Of course they are not
suitable to implement an operating system (it lacks an interrupt system) they
manage their own (turing-machine-like) memory and dispose of their own set of
opcodes (brainfuck instructions). They also link input and output to the
hypervisor's stdin and stdout.

Well, it's a cool thing to do !

If you are willing to understand the code, I recommend the python or C
version which are the most readable.

The javascript version is not finnished yet (it lacks an instruction) and I
don't plan on filling this blank in a near future.
